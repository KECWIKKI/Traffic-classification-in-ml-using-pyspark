# Traffic Classification in Machine Learning using PySpark

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify traffic patterns using PySpark. The aim is to leverage the power of distributed computing provided by PySpark to handle large-scale traffic data efficiently. This project explores different machine learning algorithms for traffic classification and aims to achieve high accuracy in predicting traffic patterns.

## Features
- Utilizes PySpark for distributed computing to handle large datasets.
- Implements machine learning algorithms for traffic classification.
- Evaluates model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Provides insights into traffic patterns based on classification results.
